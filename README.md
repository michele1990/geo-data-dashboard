# Spatial Data Visualization and Machine Learning in Python
Welcome to my project repository for the 'Spatial Data Visualization and Machine Learning in Python' course. This repository documents my journey through creating an advanced spatial data analytics dashboard using Python and the Bokeh library. The focus of this course was to leverage the interactive data visualization capabilities of Bokeh, alongside Python's powerful machine learning tools, to analyze and present data in compelling and insightful ways.

## Course Overview
### The course covered several key areas:

Introduction to Bokeh: Learning the ins and outs of the Bokeh library to create interactive charts and visuals. This foundational knowledge was crucial for the subsequent development of an analytics dashboard.

Predictive Modeling: An exploration into machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. This model was then used to analyze our dataset and visualize forecasted results, providing deeper insights into the spatial data.

Dashboard Creation: The culmination of our Bokeh and machine learning endeavors was the creation of a comprehensive, interactive dashboard. This dashboard serves as the main platform for data analysis and visualization.

Deployment: Learning to deploy the dashboard on a lightweight server, making it accessible via a URL. This step involved practical lessons on server setup and dashboard hosting.

## Project Highlights
# In this repository, you'll find:

Bokeh Visualizations: Examples of various interactive charts and plots created with Bokeh, showcasing different aspects of our spatial dataset.
Predictive Model: The Python code for our machine learning model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Dashboard Code: The complete code for the interactive dashboard developed during the course. This includes both the front-end visualizations in Bokeh and the back-end server setup.
Deployment Guide: A brief guide on how to deploy the dashboard to a server, making the project accessible to anyone interested in exploring our data visualizations.

## Getting Started
To explore this project, you can clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Detailed instructions on setting up your environment, running the predictive model, and launching the dashboard are provided in the respective directories.
